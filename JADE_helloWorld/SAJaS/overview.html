The Simple API for JADE-based Simulations (SAJaS) is a proposal to bridge the gap between MAS simulation and development. SAJaS enhances MABS frameworks with JADE-based features. While empowering MABS modellers with modelling concepts offered by JADE, SAJaS also promotes a quicker development of simulation models for JADE programmers. In fact, the same implementation can, with minor changes, be used as a large scale simulation or as a distributed JADE system. 
<br>
SAJaS provides, for certain kinds of applications, increased simulation performance, as compared to JADE.
<p>
The current version of SAJaS is integrated and has been tested with JADE 4.3.3.
<br>
SAJaS comes with interfaces to Repast 3 and Repast Simphony 2.3.1.
